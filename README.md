# What the script does
The builtin calendar app in the windows taskbar does not show the week number in the calendar widget.
This small script creates a taskbar entry with the current week number

# Installation
Easiest way is to download the released executable and double click to run it.
Geekiest way to install the script is to clone the repo and build using Visual Studio :)

# Stopping the script
Right Click on the tray icon and click on exit

# Run automatically during startup
The executable can be set to run during system startup.
 - Create a shortcut of the executable by right clicking on it and selecting "Create shortcut" from the context menu
 - Press the Windows logo key + R, type shell:startup, then select OK. This opens the Startup folder.
 - Copy the shortcut created in the first step to the Startup folder.
 - The executable will run automatically during next startup
